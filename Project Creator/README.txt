Main Project Creation Tool 

This tool will allow any company to create its own customized projects, 
designed to support its own unique requirements. 
The project creation tool is the main window the local DevOps team 
will use to create its projects. A project is a set of prerequisites, 
pre and post installation tasks, and action-providers the Installation Builder 
will then be able to use to create any set of installation sequels.
